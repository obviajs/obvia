# Obvia
Obvia is an MIT-licensed open source Javascript framework created to make the development of single page applications as easy and obvious as possible. It is designed with the objective of being easy to work with, separating code from data, separating structural components (layout) from functional components and allowing embedded state and history management. Obvia consists of UI components, application and applets, general use libraries, and code generation utilities.

## Browser Compatibility
Obvia supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).
